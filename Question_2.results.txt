Speedup = 1360/50 = 27.2
Efficiency = 1360/(50*32) = 0.85

The speedup and efficiency is relatively good, likely for the following reasons: 
-minimal communication between processes: processes only need to check if a message has been received every 500 loop iterations
-balanced distribution of work between processes: every process should analyze approximately the same number of primes

The two loops required for computing the next start index for each process prevent the efficiency/speed from being any higher. The loops run p times, so this overhead increases as p increases.
